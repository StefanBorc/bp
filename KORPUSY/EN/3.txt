excerpt from the University of Michigan The University Record April Bentley showcases items from World War I 'Polar Bears' ; by Joanne Nesbit During the summer of the U S Army's th Division made up primarily of men from Michigan and Wisconsin completed training at Fort Custer in Battle Creek Mich and proceeded to England The troops of the division's th Infantry and support units realized that they were not being sent to France to join the great battles on the Western Front when they were issued Russian weapons and equipment and lectured on life in the Arctic regions When they reached their destination in early September miles north of Moscow the men of the th joined an international force commanded by the British that had been sent to northern Russia for purposes that were never made clear The Americans were soon spread in small fighting units across hundreds of miles of the Russian forest fighting the Bolsheviks who had taken power in Petrograd and Moscow The day of the Armistice (Nov ) when fighting ceased for other American armies the allied soldiers were fighting the Bolsheviks said to be led by Trotsky himself After three days the allies finally were able to drive off the Bolsheviks While this fight was a victory for the Americans the battle led to the realization that the war was not over for these men As the weeks and months passed and more battles were fought the men began to wonder if they would ever get home The men of the th generally were well equipped with winter clothing during the winter of while stationed near the Arctic Circle where temperatures reached minus degrees Fahrenheit There was little daylight for months at a time Knowing that the war was over for other American soldiers the morale of the troops declined throughout the winter Families and friends of the men began to clamor for their return Politicians unwilling to support an undeclared war against the Russian government joined in their demand A petition to Congress was circulated Several of the British and French units mutinied and refused to continue fighting In early April the American troops learned that they would be withdrawn as soon as the harbor at Archangel was cleared of ice It was not until June of that the men of the th sailed from Russia and adopted the polar bear as their regimental symbol After a stop in New York the troops went on to Detroit where

WASHINGTON NOVEMBER With the signing of the Armistice on November the World War has been practically brought to an end The events of the past four years have been of such magnitude that the various steps the numberless battles and the growth of Allied power which led up to the final victory are not clearly defined even in the minds of many military men A history of this great period which will state in an orderly fashion this series of events will be of the greatest value to the future students of the war and to everyone of the present day who desires to refer in exact terms to matters which led up to the final conclusion The war will be discussed and re discussed from every angle and the sooner such a compilation of facts is available the more valuable it will be I understand that this History of the World War intends to put at the disposal of all who are interested such a compendium of facts of the past period of over four years; and that the system employed in safeguarding the accuracy of statements contained in it will produce a document of great historical value without entering upon any speculative conclusions as to cause and effect of the various phases of the war or attempting to project into an historical document individual opinions With these ends in view this History will be of the greatest value Signature [Payton C March] General Chief of Staff United

PRESIDENT WILSON'S REVIEW OF THE WAR A Year in the Life of the United States Crowded with Great Events Tribute to the Soldiers and Sailors the Workers at Home Who Supplied the Sinews of the Great Undertaking the Women of the Land Who Contributed to the Great Result The Future Safe in the Hands of American Businessmen SUMMARIZED CHRONOLOGY OF THE WAR FOREWORD This is a popular narrative history of the world's greatest war Written frankly from the viewpoint of the United States and the Allies it visualizes the bloodiest and most destructive conflict of all the ages from its remote causes to its glorious conclusion and beneficent results The world shaking rise of new democracies is set forth and the enormous national and individual sacrifices producing that resurrection of human equality are detailed Two ideals have been before us in the preparation of this necessary work These are simplicity and thoroughness It is of no avail to describe the greatest of human events if the description is so confused that the reader loses interest Thoroughness is an historical essential beyond price So it is that official documents prepared in many instances upon the field of battle and others taken from the files of the governments at war are the basis of this work Maps and photographs of unusual clearness and high authenticity illuminate the text All that has gone into war making into the regeneration of the world are herein set forth with historical particularity The stark horrors of Belgium the blighting terrors of chemical warfare the governmental restrictions placed upon hundreds of millions of civilians the war sacrifices falling upon all the civilized peoples of earth are in these pages It is a book that mankind can well read and treasure CHAPTER I A WAR FOR INTERNATIONAL FREEDOM My FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: The armistice was signed this morning Everything for which America fought has been accomplished The war thus comes to an end Speaking to the Congress and the people of the United States President Wilson made this declaration on November A few hours before he made this statement Germany the empire of blood and iron had agreed to an armistice terms of which were the hardest and most humiliating ever imposed upon a nation of the first class It was the end of a war for which Germany had prepared for generations a war bred of a philosophy that Might can take its toll of earth's possessions of human lives and liberties when and where it will That philosophy involved the cession to imperial Germany of the best years of young German manhood the training of German youths to be killers of men It involved the creation of a military caste arrogant beyond all precedent a caste that set its strength and pride against the righteousness of democracy against the possession of wealth and bodily comforts a caste that visualized itself as part of a power mad Kaiser's assumption that he and God were to shape the destinies of earth When Marshal Foch the foremost strategist in the world representing the governments of the Allies and the United States delivered to the emissaries of Germany terms upon which they might surrender he brought to an end the bloodiest the most destructive and the most beneficent war the world has known It is worthy of note in this connection that the three great wars in which the United States of America engaged have been wars for freedom The Revolutionary War was for the liberty of the colonies; the Civil War was waged for the freedom of manhood and for the principle of the indissolubility of the Union; the World War beginning was fought for the right of small nations to self government and for the right of every country to the free use of the high seas HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR More than four million American men were under arms when the conflict ended Of these more than two million were upon the fields of France and Italy These were thoroughly trained in the military art They had proved their right to be considered among the most formidable soldiers the world has known Against the brown rock of that host in khaki the flower of German savagery and courage had broken at ChateauThierry There the high tide of Prussian militarism after what had seemed to be an irresistible dash for the destruction of France spent itself in the bloody froth and spume of bitter defeat There the Prussian Guard encountered the Marines the Iron Division and the other heroic organizations of America's new army There German soldiers who had been hardened and trained under German conscription before the war and who had learned new arts in their bloody trade through their service in the World War met their masters in young Americans taken from the shop the field and the forge youths who had been sent into battle with a scant six months' intensive training in the art of war Not only did these American soldiers hold the German onslaught where it was but in a sudden fierce resistless counter thrust they drove back in defeat and confusion the Prussian Guard the Pommeranian Reserves and smashed the morale of that German division beyond hope of resurrection The news of that exploit sped from the Alps to the North Sea Coast through all the camps of the Allies with incredible rapidity The Americans have held the Germans They can fight ran the message New life came into the war weary ranks of heroic poilus and into the steel hard armies of Great Britain The Americans are as good as the best There are millions of them and millions more are coming was heard on every side The transfusion of American blood came as magic tonic and from that glorious day there was never a doubt as to the speedy defeat of Germany From that day the German retreat dated The armistice signed on November was merely the period finishing the death sentence of German militarism the first word of which was uttered at Chateau Thierry Germany's defiance to the world her determination to force her will and her kultur upon the democracies of earth produced the conflict She called to her aid three sister autocracies: Turkey a land ruled by the whims of a long line of moody misanthropic monarchs; Bulgaria the traitor nation cast by its Teutonic king into a war in which its people had no choice and little sympathy; Austria Hungary a congeries of races in which a Teutonic minority ruled with an iron scepter A WAR FOR INTERNATIONAL FREEDOM Against this phalanx of autocracy twenty four nations arrayed themselves Populations of these twenty eight warring nations far exceeded the total population of all the remainder of humanity The conflagration of war literally belted the earth It consumed the most civilized of capitals It raged in the swamps and forests of Africa To its call came alien peoples speaking words that none but themselves could translate wearing garments of exotic cut and hue amid the smart garbs and sober hues of modern civilization A twentieth century Babel came to the fields of France for freedom's sake and there was born an internationalism making for the future understanding and peace of the world The list of the twenty eight nations entering the World War and their populations follow: Never before in the history of the world were so many races and peoples mingled in a military effort as those that came together under the command of Marshal Foch If we divide the human races into white yellow red and black all four were largely represented Among the white races there were Frenchmen Italians Portuguese English Scottish Welsh Irish Canadians Australians South Africans (of both British and Dutch descent) New Zealanders; in the American army probably every other European nation was represented with additional contingents from those already named so that every branch of the white race figured in the ethnological total There were representatives of many Asiatic races including not only the volunteers from the native states of India but elements from the French colony in Cochin China with Annam Cambodia Tonkin Laos and Kwang Chau Wan England and France both contributed many African tribes including Arabs from Algeria and Tunis Senegalese Saharans and many of the South African races The red races of North America were represented in the armies of both Canada and the United States while the Maoris Samoans and other Polynesian races were likewise represented And as in the American Army there were men of German Austrian and Hungarian descent and in all probability contingents also of Bulgarian and Turkish blood it may be said that Foch commanded an army representing the whole human race united in defense of the ideals of the Allies It will be seen that more than ten times the number of neutral persons were engulfed in the maelstrom of war Millions of these suffered from it during the entire period of the conflict four years three months and fifteen days a total of days For almost four years Germany rolled up a record of victories on land and of piracies on and under the seas A WAR FOR INTERNATIONAL FREEDOM TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY THE ALLIES UNDER THE ARMISTICE OF NOVEMBER Dotted area invaded territory of Belgium France Luxembourg and Alsace Lorraine to be evacuated in fourteen days; area in small squares part of Germany west of the Rhine to be evacuated in twenty five days and occupied by Allied and U S troops; lightly shaded area to east of Rhine neutral zone; black semi circles bridge heads of thirty kilometers radius in the neutral zone to be occupied by Allied armies HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR Little by little day after day piracies dwindled as the murderous submarine was mastered and its menace strangled On the land the Allies under the matchless leadership of Marshal Ferdinand Foch and the generous co operation of Americans British French and Italians under the great Generals Pershing Haig Petain and Diaz wrested the initiative from von Hindenburg and Ludendorf late in July Then in one hundred and fifteen days of wonderful strategy and the fiercest fighting the world has ever witnessed Foch and the Allies closed upon the Germanic armies the jaws of a steel trap A series of brilliant maneuvers dating from the battle of Chateau Thierry in which the Americans checked the Teutonic rush resulted in the defeat and rout on all the fronts of the Teutonic commands In that titanic effort America's share was that of the final deciding factor A nation unjustly titled the Dollar Nation believed by Germany and by other countries to be soft selfish and wasteful became over night hard as tempered steel self sacrificing with an altruism that inspired the world and thrifty beyond all precedent in order that not only its own armies but the armies of the Allies might be fed and munitioned Leading American thought and American action President Wilson stood out as the prophet of the democracies of the world Not only did he inspire America and the Allies to a military and naval effort beyond precedent but he inspired the civilian populations of the world to extraordinary effort efforts that eventually won the war For the decision was gained quite as certainly on the wheat fields of Western America in the shops and the mines and the homes of America as it was upon the battle field This effort came in response to the following appeal by the President: These then are the things we must do and do well besides fighting the things without which mere fighting would be fruitless: We must supply abundant food for ourselves and for our armies and our seamen not only but also for a large part of the nations with whom we have now made common cause in whose support and by whose sides we shall be fighting; We must supply ships by the hundreds out of our shipyards to carry to the other side of the sea submarines or no submarines what will every day be needed there; and A WAR FOR INTERNATIONAL FREEDOM Abundant materials out of our fields and our mines and our factories with which not only to clothe and equip our own forces on land and sea but also to clothe and support our people for whom the gallant fellows under arms can no longer work to help clothe and equip the armies with which we are co operating in Europe and to keep the looms and manufactories there in raw material; Coal to keep the fires going in ships at sea and in the furnaces of hundreds of factories across the sea; Steel out of which to make arms and ammunition both here and there; Rails for worn out railways back of the fighting fronts; Locomotives and rolling stock to take the place of those every day going to pieces; Everything with which the people of England and France and Italy and Russia have usually supplied themselves but cannot now afford the men the materials or the machinery to make I particularly appeal to the farmers of the South to plant abundant foodstuffs as well as cotton They can show their patriotism in no better or more convincing way than by resisting the great temptation of the present price of cotton and helping helping upon a large scale to feed the nation and the peoples everywhere who are fighting for their liberties and for our own The variety of their crops will be the visible measure of their comprehension of their national duty The response was amazing in its enthusiastic and general compliance No autocracy issuing a ukase could have been obeyed so explicitly Not only did the various classes of workers and individuals observe the President's suggestions to the letter but they yielded up individual right after right in order that the war work of the government might be expedited Extraordinary powers and functions were granted by the people through Congress and it was not until peace was declared that these rights and powers returned to the people These governmental activities ceased functioning after the war: Food administration; Fuel administration; Espionage act; War trade board; Alien property custodian (with extension of time for certain duties); Agricultural stimulation; Housing construction (except for shipbuilders); Control of telegraphs and telephones; Export control HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR These functions were extended: Control over railroads: to cease within twenty one months after the proclamation of peace The War Finance Corporation: to cease to function six months after the war with further time for liquidation The Capital Issues Committee: to terminate in six months after the peace proclamation The Aircraft Board: to end in six months after peace was proclaimed; and the government operation of ships within five years after the war was officially ended President Wilson generally acclaimed as the leader of the world's democracies phrased for civilization the arguments against autocracy in the great peace conference after the war The President headed the American delegation to that conclave of world re construction With him as delegates to the conference were Robert Lansing Secretary of State; Henry White former Ambassador to France and Italy; Edward M House and General Tasker H Bliss Representing American Labor at the International Labor conference held in Paris simultaneously with the Peace Conference were Samuel Gompers president of the American Federation of Labor; William Green secretary treasurer of the United Mine Workers of America; John R Alpine president of the Plumbers' Union; James Duncan president of the International Association of Granite Cutters; Frank Duffy president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and Frank Morrison secretary of the American Federation of Labor Estimating the share of each Allied nation in the great victory mankind will conclude that the heaviest cost in proportion to prewar population and treasure was paid by the nations that first felt the shock of war Belgium Serbia Poland and France All four were the battle grounds of huge armies oscillating in a bloody frenzy over once fertile fields and once prosperous towns Belgium with a population of had a casualty list of more than ; France with its casualties of out of a population (including its colonies) of is really the martyr nation of the world Her gallant

Africa and Egypt It raised its navy personnel from to men Co operating with its allies on the sea it destroyed approximately one hundred and fifty German and Austrian submarines It aided materially the American navy and transport service in sending overseas the great American army whose coming decided the war The British navy and transport service during the war made the following record of transportation and convoy: Twenty million men horses tons of food tons of explosives and supplies tons of oil and fuels vehicles In alone men animals vehicles and tons of stores were conveyed to the several war fronts The German losses were estimated at killed or died of disease; wounded; and prisoners and missing A tabulation of the estimates of casualties and the money cost of the war reveals

the cost in connection with the liberation of whole nations with the spread of enlightened liberty through oppressed and benighted lands with the destruction of autocracy of the military caste and of Teutonic kultur in its materialistic aspect must agree that the blood was well shed the treasure well spent Millions of gallant eager youths learned how to die fearlessly and gloriously They died to teach vandal nations that nevermore will humanity permit the exploitation of peoples for militaristic purposes As Milton the great philosopher poet phrased the lesson taught to Germany on the fields of France: They err who count it glorious to subdue By conquest far and wide to overrun Large countries and in field great battles win Great cities by assault; what do these worthies But rob and spoil burn slaughter and enslave Peaceable nations neighboring or remote Made captive yet deserving freedom more Than those their conquerors who leave behind Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove And all the flourishing works of peace destroy CHAPTER II THE WORLD SUDDENLY TURNED UPSIDE DOWN Demoralization like the black plague of the middle ages spread in every direction immediately following the first overt acts of war Men who were millionaires at nightfall awoke the next morning to find themselves bankrupt through depreciation of their stockholdings Prosperous firms of importers were put out of business International commerce was dislocated to an extent unprecedented in history The greatest of hardships immediately following the war however were visited upon those who unhappily were caught on their vacations or on their business trips within the area affected by the war Not only men but women and children were subjected to privations of the severest character Notes which had been negotiable paper money of every description and even silver currency suddenly became of little value Americans living in hotels and pensions facing this sudden shrinkage in their money were compelled to leave the roofs that had sheltered them That which was true of Americans was true of all other nationalities so that every embassy and the office of every consul became a miniature Babel of excited distressed humanity The sudden seizure of railroads for war purposes in Germany France Austria and Russia cut off thousands of travelers in villages that were almost inaccessible Europeans being comparatively close to their homes were not in straits as severe as the Americans whose only hope for aid lay in the speedy arrival of American gold Prices of food soared beyond all precedent and many of these hapless strangers went under Paris the brightest and gayest city in Europe suddenly became the most somber of dwelling places No traffic was permitted on the highways at night No lights were permitted and all the cafes were closed at eight o'clock The gay capital was placed under iron military rule Seaports and especially the pleasure resorts in France Belgium and England were placed under a military supervision Visitors were ordered to return to their homes and every resort was shrouded with darkness at night The records of those early days are filled with stories of dramatic happenings HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR On the night of July st Jean Leon Jaures the famous leader of French Socialists was assassinated while dining in a small restaurant near the Paris Bourse His assassin was Raoul Villein Jaures had been endeavoring to accomplish a union of French and German Socialists with the aim of preventing the war The object of the assassination appeared to have been wholly political On the same day stock exchanges throughout the United States were closed following the example of European stock exchanges Ship insurance soared to prohibitive figures Reservists of the French and German armies living outside of their native land were called to the colors and their homeward rush still further complicated transportation for civilians All the countries of Europe clamored for gold North and South America complied with the demand by sending cargoes of the precious metal overseas The German ship Kron Prinzessin with a cargo of gold attempted to make the voyage to Hamburg but a wireless warning that Allied cruisers were waiting for it off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland compelled the big ship to turn back to safety in America Channel boats bearing American refugees from the Continent to London were described as floating hells London was excited over the war and holiday spirit and overrun with five thousand citizens of the United States tearfully pleading with the American Ambassador for money for transportation home or assurances of personal safety The condition of the terror stricken tourists fleeing to the friendly shores of England from Continental countries crowded with soldiers dragging in their wake heavy guns resulted in an extraordinary gathering of two thousand Americans at a hotel one afternoon and the formation of a preliminary organization to afford relief Some people who attended the meeting were already beginning to feel the pinch of want with little prospects of immediate succor One man and wife with four children had six cents when he appealed to Ambassador Page after an exciting escape from German territory THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN WHERE THE WORLD WAR BEGAN HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR Oscar Straus worth ten millions struck London with nine dollars Although he had letters of credit for five thousand he was unable to cash them in Vienna Women hugging newspaper bundles containing expensive Paris frocks and millinery were herded in third class carriages and compelled to stand many hours They reached London utterly fatigued and unkempt but mainly cheerful only to find the hotels choked with fellow countrymen fortunate to reach there sooner The Ambassador was harassed by anxious women and children who asked many absurd questions which he could not answer He said: The appeals of these people are most distressing They are very much excited and no small wonder I regret I have no definite news of the prospects or plans of the government for relief I have communicated their condition to the Department of State and expect a response and assurances of coming aid as soon as possible That the government will act I have not the slightest doubt I am confident that Washington will do everything in her power for relief How soon I cannot tell I have heard many distressing tales during the last forty eight hours A crowd filled the Ambassador's office on the first floor of the flat building in Victoria Street which was mainly composed of women school teachers art students and other persons doing Europe on a shoestring Many were entirely out of money and with limited securities which were not negotiable The action of the British Government extending the bank holiday till Thursday of that week was discouraging news for the new arrivals from the Continent as it was uncertain whether the express and steamship companies would open in the morning for the cashing of checks and the delivery of mail as was announced the previous Saturday Doctors J Riddle Goffe of New York; Frank F Simpson of Pittsburgh; Arthur D Ballon of Vistaburg Mich and B F Martin of Chicago formed themselves into a committee and asked the co operation of the press in America to bring about adequate assistance for the marooned Americans and to urge the bankers of the United States to insist on their letters of credit and travelers' checks being honored so far as possible by the agents in Europe upon whom they were drawn THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS In the first weeks of the war the Germans occupied Rheims but were driven out after von Kluck's retreat On September they were reported as first shelling the Cathedral of Rheims and the civilized world stood aghast for the edifice begun in is one of the chief glories of Gothic architecture in all Europe HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR Photo by Underwood and Underwood N Y THE KAISER AND HIS SIX SONS The ex Emperor and his sons leading a procession in Berlin soon after the declaration of war It was noted that in spite of their martial appearance the royal family were extremely careful to keep out of range of the Allied guns From left to right they are: The Kaiser Crown Prince Wilhelm Princes Eitel Friedrich Adalbert August Oscar and Joachim THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN Dr Martin and Dr Simpson who left London on Saturday for Switzerland to fetch back a young American girl were unable to get beyond Paris and they returned to London Everywhere they found trains packed with refugees whose only object in life apparently was to reach the channel boats accepting cheerfully the discomforts of those vessels if only able to get out of the war Rev J P Garfield of Claremore N H gave the following account of his experiences in Holland: On sailing from the Hook of Holland near midnight we pulled out just as the boat train from The Hague arrived The steamer paused but as she was filled to her capacity she later continued on her voyage leaving fully two hundred persons marooned on the wharf Our discomforts while crossing the North Sea were great Every seat was filled with sleepers the cabins were given to women and children The crowd as a rule was helpful and kindly the single men carrying the babies and people lending money to those without funds Despite the refugee conditions prevailing it was noticeable that many women on the Hook wharf clung tenaciously to bandboxes containing Parisian hats Travelers from Cologne said that searchlights were operated from the tops of the hotels all night searching for airplanes and machine guns were mounted on the famous Cologne Cathedral They also reported that tourists were refused hotel accommodations at Frankfort because they were without cash Men women and children sat in the streets all night The trains were stopped several miles from the German frontier and the passengers especially the women and children suffered great hardship being forced to continue their journey on foot Passengers arriving at London from Montreal on the Cunard Line steamer Andania bound for Southampton reported the vessel was met at sea by a British torpedo boat and ordered by wireless to stop The liner then was led into Plymouth as a matter of precaution against mines Plymouth was filled with soldiers and searchlights were seen constantly flashing about the harbor Otis B Kent an attorney for the Interstate Commerce Commission of Washington arrived in London after an exciting journey from Petrograd Unable to find accommodations at a hotel he slept on the railway station floor He said: I had been on a trip to Sweden to see the midnight sun I did not realize the gravity of the situation until I saw the Russian fleet cleared for action This was only July th at Kronstadt where the shipyards were working overtime HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR I arrived at the Russian capital on the following day Enormous demonstrations were taking place I was warned to get out and left on the night of the th for Berlin I saw Russian soldiers drilling at the stations and artillery constantly on the move At Berlin I was warned to keep off the streets for fear of being mistaken for an Englishmen At Hamburg the number of warnings was increased Two Russians who refused to rise in a cafe when the German anthem was played were attacked and badly beaten I also saw two Englishmen attacked in the street but they finally were rescued by the police There was a harrowing scene when the Hamburg American Line steamer Imperator canceled its sailing She left stranded three thousand passengers most of them short of money and the women wailing About one hundred and fifty of us were given passage in the second class of the American Line steamship Philadelphia for which I was offered $ by a speculator The journey to Flushing was made in a packed train its occupants lacking sleep and food No trouble was encountered on the frontier Theodore Hetzler of the Fifth Avenue Bank was appointed chairman of the meeting for preliminary relief of the stranded tourists and committees were named to interview officials of the steamship companies and of the hotels to search for lost baggage to make arrangements for the honoring of all proper checks and notes and to confer with the members of the American embassy Oscar Straus who arrived from Paris said that the United States embassy there was working hard to get Americans out of France Great enthusiasm prevailed at the French capital he said owing to the announcement that the United States Government was considering a plan to send transports to take Americans home The following committees were appointed at the meeting: Finance Theodore Hetzler Fred I Kent and James G Cannon; Transportation Joseph F Day Francis M Weld and George D Smith all of New York; Diplomatic Oscar S Straus Walter L Fisher and James Byrne; Hotels L H Armour of Chicago and Thomas J Shanley New York THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN The committee established headquarters where Americans might register and obtain assistance Chandler Anderson a member of the International Claims Commission arrived in London from Paris He said he had been engaged with the work of the commission at Versailles when he was warned by the American embassy that he had better leave France He acted promptly on this advice and the commission was adjourned until after the war Mr Anderson had to leave his baggage behind him because the railway company would not register it He said the city of Paris presented a strange contrast to the ordinary animation prevailing there Most of the shops were closed There were no taxis in the streets and only a few vehicles drawn by horses The armored cruiser Tennessee converted for the time being into a treasure ship left New York on the night of August th to carry $ in gold to the many thousand Americans who were in want in European countries Included in the $ was $ appropriated by the government Private consignments in gold in sums from $ to $ were accepted by Colonel Smith of the army quartermaster's department who undertook their delivery to Americans in Paris and other European ports The cruiser carried as passengers Ambassador Willard who returned to his post at Madrid and army and naval officers assigned as military observers in Europe On the return trip accommodations for Americans were available The dreadnaught Florida after being hastily coaled and provisioned left the Brooklyn Navy Yard under sealed orders at o'clock the morning of August th and proceeded to Tompkinsville where she dropped anchor near the Tennessee The Florida was sent to protect the neutrality of American ports and prohibit supplies to belligerent ships Secretary Daniels ordered her to watch the port of New York and sent the Mayflower to Hampton Roads Destroyers guarded ports along the New England coast and those at Lewes Del to prevent violations of neutrality at Philadelphia and in that territory Any vessel that attempted to sail for a belligerent port without clearance papers was boarded by American officials The Texas and Louisiana at Vera Cruz and the Minnesota at Tampico were ordered to New York and Secretary Daniels announced that other American vessels would be ordered north as fast as room could be found for them in navy yard docks HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR At wireless stations under the censorship ordered by the President no code messages were allowed in any circumstances Messages which might help any of the belligerents in any way were barred The torpedo boat destroyer Warrington and the revenue cutter Androscoggin arrived at Bar Harbor on August th to enforce neutrality regulations and allowed no foreign ships to leave Frenchman's Bay without clearance papers The United States cruiser Milwaukee sailed the same day from the Puget Sound Navy Yard to form part of the coast patrol to enforce neutrality regulations Arrangements were made in Paris by Myron T Herrick the American Ambassador acting under instructions from Washington to take over the affairs of the German embassy while Alexander H Thackara the American Consul General looked after the affairs of the German consulate President Poincare and the members of the French cabinet later issued a joint proclamation to the French nation in which was the phrase mobilization is not war The marching of the soldiers in the streets with the English Russian and French flags flying the singing of patriotic songs and the shouting of On to Berlin were much less remarkable than the general demeanor and cold resolution of most of the people The response to the order of mobilization was instant and the stations of all the railways particularly those leading to the eastward were crowded with reservists Many women accompanied the men until close to the stations where softly crying farewells were said The troop trains left at frequent intervals All the automobile busses disappeared having been requisitioned by the army to carry meat the coachwork of the vehicles being removed and replaced with specially designed bodies A large number of taxicabs private automobiles and horses and carts also were taken over by the military for transport purposes The wildest enthusiasm was manifested on the boulevards when the news of the ordering of the mobilization became known Bodies of men formed into regular companies in ranks ten deep paraded the streets waving the tricolor and other national emblems and cheering and singing the Marseillaise and the Internationale at the same time throwing their hats in the air On the sidewalks were many weeping women and children All the stores and cafes were deserted THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN All foreigners were compelled to leave Paris or France before the end of the first day of mobilization by train but not by automobile Time tables were posted on the walls of Paris giving the times of certain trains on which these people might leave the city American citizens or British subjects were allowed to remain in France except in the regions on the eastern frontier and near certain fortresses provided they made declaration to the police and obtained a special permit As to Italy's situation Rome was quite calm and the normal aspect made tourists decide that Italy was the safest place Austria's note to Serbia was issued without consulting Italy One point of the Triple Alliance provided that no member should take action in the Balkans before an agreement with the other allies Such an agreement did not take place The alliance was of defensive not aggressive character and could not force an ally to follow any enterprise taken on the sole account and without a notice as such action taken by Austria against Serbia It was felt even then that Italy would eventually cast its lot with the Entente Allies Secretary of the Treasury William G McAdoo; John Skelton Williams Comptroller of the Currency; Charles S Hamblin and William P G Harding members of the Federal Reserve Board went to New York early in August where they discussed relief measures with a group of leading bankers at what was regarded as the most momentous conference of the kind held in the country in recent years The New York Clearing House Committee on August d called a meeting of the Clearing House Association to arrange for the immediate issuance of clearing house certificates Among those at the conference were J P Morgan and his partner Henry P Davison; Frank A Vanderlip president of the National City Bank and A Barton Hepburn chairman of the Chase National Bank CHAPTER III WHY THE WORLD WENT TO WAR While it is true that the war was conceived in Berlin it is none the less true that it was born in the Balkans It is necessary in order that we may view with correct perspective the background of the World War that we gain some notion of the Balkan States and the complications entering into their relations These countries have been the adopted children of the great European powers during generations of rulers Russia assumed guardianship of the nations having a preponderance of Slavic blood; Roumania with its Latin consanguinities was close to France and Italy; Bulgaria Greece and Balkan Turkey were debatable regions wherein the diplomats of the rival nations secured temporary victories by devious methods The Balkans have fierce hatreds and have been the site of sudden historic wars At the time of the declaration of the World War the Balkan nations were living under the provisions of the Treaty of Bucharest dated August Greece Roumania Bulgaria Serbia and Montenegro were signers and Turkey acquiesced in its provisions The assassination at Sarajevo had sent a convulsive shudder throughout the Balkans The reason lay in the century old antagonism between the Slav and the Teuton Serbia Montenegro and Russia had never forgiven Austria for seizing Bosnia and Herzegovina and making these Slavic people subjects of the Austrian crown Bulgaria Roumania and Turkey remained cold at the news of the assassination German diplomacy was in the ascendant at these courts and the prospect of war with Germany as their great ally presented no terrors for them The sympathies of the people of Greece were with Serbia but the Grecian Court because the Queen of Greece was the only sister of the German Kaiser was whole heartedly with Austria Perhaps at the first the Roumanians were most nearly neutral They believed strongly that each of the small nations of the Balkan region as well as all of the small nations that had been absorbed but had not been digested by Austria should cut itself from the leading strings held by the large European powers WHY THE WORLD WENT TO WAR PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY OF BUCHAREST There was a distinct undercurrent for a federation resembling that of the United States of America between these peoples This was expressed most clearly by M Jonesco leader of the Liberal party of Roumania and generally recognized as the ablest statesman of middle Europe He declared: HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR I always believed and still believe that the Balkan States cannot secure their future otherwise than by a close understanding among themselves whether this understanding shall or shall not take the form of a federation No one of the Balkan States is strong enough to resist the pressure from one or another of the European powers For this reason I am deeply grieved to see in the Balkan coalition of Roumania not invited If Roumania had taken part in the first one we should not have had the second I did all that was in my power and succeeded in preventing the war between Roumania and the Balkan League in the winter of I risked my popularity and I do not feel sorry for it I employed all my efforts to prevent the second Balkan war which as is well known was profitable to us I repeatedly told the Bulgarians that they ought not to enter it because in that case we would enter it too But I was not successful in my efforts During the second Balkan war I did all in my power to end it as quickly as possible At the conference at Bucharest I made efforts as Mr Pashich and Mr Venizelos know very well to secure for beaten Bulgaria the best terms My object was to obtain a new coalition of all the Balkan States including Roumania Had I succeeded in this the situation would be much better No reasonable man will deny that the Balkan States are neutralizing each other at the present time which in itself makes the whole situation all the more miserable In October when I succeeded in facilitating the conclusion of peace between Greece and Turkey I was pursuing the same object of the Balkan coalition On my return from Athens I endeavored though without success to put the Greco Turkish relations on a basis of friendship being convinced that the well understood interest of both countries lies not only in friendly relations but even in an alliance between them The dissensions that exist between the Balkan States can be settled in a friendly way without war The best moment for this would be after the general war when the map of Europe will be remade The Balkan country which would start war against another Balkan country would commit not only a crime against her own future but an act of folly as well WHY THE WORLD WENT TO WAR The destiny and future of the Balkan States and of all the small European peoples as well will not be regulated by fratricidal wars but with this great European struggle the real object of which is to settle the question whether Europe shall enter an era of justice and therefore happiness for the small peoples or whether we will face a period of oppression more or less gilt edged And as I always believed that wisdom and truth will triumph in the end I want to believe too that in spite of the pessimistic news reaching me from the different sides of the Balkan countries there will be no war among them in order to justify those who do not believe in the vitality of the small peoples The conference at Rome April to settle outstanding questions between the Italians and the Slavs of the Adriatic drew attention to those Slavonic peoples in Europe who were under non Slavonic rule At the beginning of the war there were three great Slavonic groups in Europe: First the Russians with the Little Russians speaking languages not more different than the dialect of Yorkshire is from the dialect of Devonshire; second a central group including the Poles the Czechs or Bohemians the Moravians and Slovaks this group thus being separated under the four crowns of Russia Germany Austria and Hungary; the third the southern group included the Sclavonians the Croatians the Dalmatians Bosnians Herzegovinians the Slavs generally called Slovenes in the western part of Austria down to Goritzia and also the two independent kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia Like the central group this southern group of Slavs was divided under four crowns Hungary Austria Montenegro and Serbia; but in spite of the fact that half belong to the Western and half to the Eastern Church they are all essentially the same people though with considerable infusion of non Slavonic blood there being a good deal of Turkish blood in Bosnia and Herzegovina The languages however are practically identical formed largely of pure Slavonic materials and curiously much more closely connected with the eastern Slav group Russia and Little Russia than with the central group Polish and Bohemian A Russian of Moscow will find it much easier to understand a Slovene from Goritzia than a Pole from Warsaw The Ruthenians in southern Galicia and Bukowina are identical in race and speech with the Little Russians of Ukrainia HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR Of the central group the Poles have generally inclined to Austria which has always supported the Polish landlords of Galicia against the Ruthenian peasantry; while the Czechs have been not so much anti Austrian as anti German Indeed the Hapsburg rulers have again and again played these Slavs off against their German subjects It was the Southern Slav question as affecting Serbia and Austria that gave the pretext for the present war The central Slav question affecting the destiny of the Poles was a bone of contention between Austria and Germany It is the custom to call the Southern Slavs Jugoslavs from the Slav word Yugo south but as this is a concession to German transliteration many prefer to write the word Yugoslav which represents its pronunciation The South Slav question was created by the incursions of three Asiatic peoples Huns Magyars Turks who broke up the originally continuous Slav territory that ran from the White Sea to the confines of Greece and the Adriatic THE MIXTURE OF RACES IN SOUTH CENTRAL EUROPE WHY THE WORLD WENT TO WAR Underwood and Underwood N Y SERBS DEFENDING THE MOUNTAIN PASSES LEADING TO THEIR CAPITAL Little Serbia before she was overwhelmed by the concentrated force of a mighty Teuton drive and afterward did some fighting that astonished the world The photo shows some of her artillery engaged in holding back the enemy in the mountain regions near Nish HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR A SCENE FROM EARLY TRENCH WARFARE From the woods in the background the British charge on an angle of the German breastworks under cover of artillery and machine gun fire This illustrates the early trench warfare before the development of the elaborate concrete protected structures the Germans later devised They can be seen wearing the famous spiked helmets which were later replaced by steel ones WHY THE WORLD WENT TO WAR This was the complex of nationalities the ferment of races existing in Out of the hatreds engendered by the domination over the liberty loving Slavic peoples by an arrogant Teutonic minority grew the assassinations at Sarajevo These crimes were the expression of hatred not for the heir apparent of Austria but for the Hapsburg and their Germanic associates By a twist of the wheel of fate the same Slavic peoples whose determination to rid themselves of the Teutonic yoke started the war also bore rather more than their share in the swift moving events that decided and closed the war Russia the dying giant among the great nations championed the Slavic peoples at the beginning of the war It entered the conflict in aid of little Serbia but at the end Russia bowed to Germany in the infamous peace treaty at Brest Litovsk Thereafter during the last months of the war Russia was virtually an ally of its ancient enemy Turkey the Sick Man of Europe and the central German empires With these allies the Bolshevik government of Russia attempted to head off the Czecho Slovak regiments that had been captured by Russia during its drive into Austria and had been imprisoned in Siberia After the peace consummated at Brest Litovsk these regiments determined to fight on the side of the Allies and endeavored to make their way to the western front No war problems were more difficult than those of the Czecho Slovaks Few have been handled so masterfully Surrounded by powerful enemies which for centuries have been bent on destroying every trace of Slavic culture they had learned how to defend themselves against every trick or scheme of the brutal Germans The Czecho Slovak plan in Russia was of great value to the Allies all over the world and was put at their service by Professor Thomas G Masaryk He went to Russia when everything was adrift and got hold of Bohemian prisoners here and there and organized them into a compact little army of to men Equipped and fed he moved them to whatever point had most power to thoroughly disrupt the German plans They did much to check the German army for months They resolutely refused to take any part in Russian political affairs and when it seemed no longer possible to work effectively in Russia this remarkable little band started on a journey all round the world to get to the western front They loyally gave up most of their arms under agreement with Lenine and Trotzky that they might peacefully proceed out of Russia via Vladivostok HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR While they were carrying out their part of the agreement and well on the way they were surprised by telegrams from Lenine and Trotzky to the Soviets in Siberia ordering them to take away their arms and intern them The story of what occurred then was told by two American engineers Emerson and Hawkins who on the way to Ambassador Francis and not being able to reach Vologda joined a band of four or five thousand The engineers were with them three months while they were making it safe along the lines of the railroad for the rest of the CzechoSlovaks to get out and incidentally for Siberians to resume peaceful occupations They were also supported by old railway organizations which had stuck bravely to them without wages and which every little while were shot up by the Bolsheviki Distress in Russia would have been much more intense had it not been for the loyalty of the railway men in sticking to their tasks Some American engineers at Irkutsk on a peaceful journey out of Russia on descending from the cars were met with a demand to surrender and shots from machine guns Some fortunately had kept hand grenades and with these and a few rifles went straight at the machine guns Although outnumbered the attackers took the guns and soon afterward took the town The Czecho Slovaks in the beginning almost unarmed went against great odds and won for themselves the right to be considered a nation Seeing the treachery of Lenine and Trotzky they went back toward the west and made things secure for their men left behind They took town after town with the arms they first took away from the Bolsheviki and Germans; but in every town they immediately set up a government with all the elements of normal life They established police and sanitary systems opened hospitals and had roads repaired leaving a handful of men in the midst of enemies to carry on the plans of their leaders American engineers speaking of the cleanliness of the Czecho Slovak army said that they lived like Spartans The whole story is a remarkable evidence of the struggle of these little people for self government The emergence of the Czecho Slovak nation has been one of the most remarkable and noteworthy features of the war Out of the confusion of the situation with the possibility of the resurrection of oppressed peoples something of the dignity of old Bohemia was comprehended and it was recognized that the Czechs were to be rescued from Austria and the Slovaks from Hungary and united in one country with entire independence This was undoubtedly due in large measure to the activities of Professor Masaryk the president of the National Executive Council of the Czecho Slovaks His four year exile in the United States had the establishment of the new nation as its fruit WHY THE WORLD WENT TO WAR Professor Masaryk called attention to the fact that there is a peculiar discrepancy between the number of states in Europe and the number of nationalities twenty seven states to seventy nationalities He explained also that almost all the states are mixed from the point of nationality From the west of Europe to the east this is found to be true and the farther east one goes the more mixed do the states become Austria is the most mixed of all the states There is no Austrian language but there are nine languages and six smaller nations or remnants of nations In all of Germany there are eight nationalities besides the Germans who have been independent and who have their own literature Turkey is an anomaly a combination of various nations overthrown and kept down Since the eighteenth century there has been a continuing strong movement from each nation to have its own state Because of the mixed peoples there is much confusion There are Roumanians in Austria but there is a kingdom of Roumania There are Southern Slavs but there are also Serbia and Montenegro It is natural that the Southern Slavs should want to be united as one state So it is with Italy There was no justice in Poland being separated in three parts to serve the dynasties of Prussia Russia and Austria The Czecho Slovaks of Austria and Hungary claimed a union The national union consists in an endeavor to make the suppressed nations free to unite them in their own states and to readjust the states that exist; to force Austria and Prussia to give up the states that should be free In the future said Doctor Masaryk there are to be sharp ethnological boundaries The Czecho Slovaks will guarantee the minorities absolute equality but they will keep the German part of their country because there are many Bohemians in it and they do not trust the Germans CHAPTER IV THE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES One factor alone caused the great war It was not the assassination at Sarajevo not the Slavic ferment of anti Teutonism in Austria and the Balkans The only cause of the world's greatest war was the determination of the German High Command and the powerful circle surrounding it that Der Tag had arrived The assassination at Sarajevo was only the peg for the pendant of war Another peg would have been found inevitably had not the projection of that assassination presented itself as the excuse Germany's military machine was ready A gray green uniform that at a distance would fade into misty obscurity had been devised after exhaustive experiments by optical dye and cloth experts co operating with the military high command These uniforms had been standardized and fitted for the millions of men enrolled in Germany's regular and reserve armies Rifles great pyramids of munitions field kitchens traveling post offices motor lorries a network of military railways leading to the French and Belgian border all these and more had been made ready German soldiers had received instructions which enabled each man at a signal to go to an appointed place where he found everything in readiness for his long forced marches into the territory of Germany's neighbors More than all this Germany's spy system the most elaborate and unscrupulous in the history of mankind had enabled the German High Command to construct in advance of the declaration of war concrete gun emplacements in Belgium and other invaded territory The cellars of dwellings and shops rented or owned by German spies were camouflaged concrete foundations for the great guns of Austria and Germany These emplacements were in exactly the right position for use against the fortresses of Germany's foes Advertisements and shop signs were used by spies as guides for the marching German armies of invasion WHY THE WORLD WENT TO WAR Press Illustrating Service KAISER WILLIAM II OF GERMANY Posterity will regard him as more responsible than any other human being for the sacrifice of millions of lives in the great war as a ruler who might have been beneficent and wise but attempted to destroy the liberties of mankind and to raise on their ruins an odious despotism To forgive him and to forget his terrible transgressions would be to condone them HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR Underwood and Underwood N Y FRANCIS JOSEPH I OF AUSTRIA THE OLD EMPEROR ON A STATE OCCASION Francis Joseph died before the war had settled the fate of the Hapsburgs The end came on November in the sixty eighth year of his reign His life was tragic He lived to see his brother executed his Queen assassinated and his only son a suicide with always before him the specter of the disintegration of his many raced empire THE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES In brief Germany had planned for war She was approximately ready for it Under the shelter of such high sounding phrases as We demand our place in the sun and The seas must be free the German people were educated into the belief that the hour of Germany's destiny was at hand GERMANY'S POSSESSIONS IN AFRICA PRIOR TO German psychologists like other German scientists had co operated with the imperial militaristic government for many years to bring the Germanic mind into a condition of docility So well did they understand the mentality and the trends of character of the German people that it was comparatively easy to impose upon them a militaristic system and philosophy by which the individual yielded countless personal liberties for the alleged good of the state HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR Rigorous and compulsory military service unquestioning adherence to the doctrine that might makes right and a cession to the All Highest as the Emperor was styled of supreme powers in the state are some of the sufferances to which the German people submitted German propaganda abroad was quite as vigorous as at home but infinitely less successful The German High Command did not expect England to enter the war It counted upon America's neutrality with a leaning toward Germany It believed that German colonization in South Africa and South America would incline these vast domains toward friendship for the Central empires How mistaken the propagandists and psychologists were events have demonstrated It was this dream of world domination by Teutonic kultur that supplied the motive leading to the world's greatest war Bosnia an unwilling province of Austria Hungary at one time a province of Serbia and overwhelmingly Slavic in its population had been seething for years with an anti Teutonic ferment The Teutonic court at Vienna leading the minority Germanic party in Austria Hungary had been endeavoring to allay the agitation among the Bosnian Slavs In pursuance of that policy Archduke Francis Ferdinand heir presumptive to the thrones of Austria and Hungary and his morganatic wife Sophia Chotek Duchess of Hohenberg on June visited Sarajevo the capital of Bosnia On the morning of that day while they were being driven through the narrow streets of the ancient town a bomb was thrown at them but they were uninjured They were driven through the streets again in the afternoon for purpose of public display A student just out of his 'teens one Gavrilo Prinzep attacked the royal party with a magazine pistol and killed both the Archduke and his wife Here was the excuse for which Germany had waited Here was the dawn of The Day The Germanic court of Austria asserted that the crime was the result of a conspiracy leading directly to the Slavic court of Serbia The Serbians in their turn declared that they knew nothing of the assassination They pointed out the fact that Sophia Chotek was a Slav and that Francis Ferdinand was more liberal than any other member of the Austrian royal household and finally that he more than any other member of the Austrian court understood and respected the Slavic character and aspirations THE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES At six o'clock on the evening of July d Austria sent an ultimatum to Serbia presenting eleven demands and stipulating that categorical replies must be delivered before six o'clock on the evening of July th Although the language in which the ultimatum was couched was humiliating to Serbia the answer was duly delivered within the stipulated time The demands of the Austrian note in brief were as follows: The Serbian Government to give formal assurance of its condemnation of Serb propaganda against Austria The next issue of the Serbian Official Journal was to contain a declaration to that effect This declaration to express regret that Serbian officers had taken part in the propaganda The Serbian Government to promise that it would proceed rigorously against all guilty of such activity This declaration to be at once communicated by the King of Serbia to his army and to be published in the official bulletin as an order of the day All anti Austrian publications in Serbia to be suppressed The Serbian political party known as the National Union to be suppressed and its means of propaganda to be confiscated All anti Austrian teaching in the schools of Serbia to be suppressed All officers civil and military who might be designated by Austria as guilty of anti Austrian propaganda to be dismissed by the Serbian Government Austrian agents to co operate with the Serbian Government in suppressing all anti Austrian propaganda and to take part in the judicial proceedings conducted in Serbia against those charged with complicity in the crime at Sarajevo Serbia to explain to Austria the meaning of anti Austrian utterances of Serbian officials at home and abroad since the assassination To the first and second demands Serbia unhesitatingly assented To the third demand Serbia assented although no evidence was given to show that Serbian officers had taken part in the propaganda The Serbian Government assented to the fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth demands also HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR Extraordinary as was the ninth demand which would allow the Austrian Government to proscribe Serbian officials so eager for peace and friendship was the Serbian Government that it assented to it with the stipulation that the Austrian Government should offer some proof of the guilt of the proscribed officers The tenth demand which in effect allowed Austrian agents to control the police and courts of Serbia it was not possible for Serbia to accept without abrogating her sovereignty However it was not unconditionally rejected but the Serbian Government asked that it be made the subject of further discussion or be referred to arbitration The Serbian Government assented to the eleventh demand on the condition that if the explanations which would be given concerning the alleged anti Austrian utterances of Serbian officials would not prove satisfactory to the Austrian Government the matter should be submitted to mediation or arbitration Behind the threat conveyed in the Austrian ultimatum was the menacing figure of militant Germany The veil that had hitherto concealed the hands that worked the string was removed when Germany under the pretense of localizing the quarrel to Serbian and Austrian soil interrogated France and England asking them to prevent Russia from defending Serbia in the event of an attack by Austria upon the Serbs England and France promptly refused to participate in a tragedy which would deliver Serbia to Austria as Bosnia had been delivered Russia bound by race and creed to Serbia read into the ultimatum of Teutonic kultur a determination for warfare Mobilization of the Russian forces along the Austrian frontier was arranged when it was seen that Serbia's pacific reply to Austria's demands would be contemptuously disregarded by Germany and Austria During the days that intervened between the issuance of the ultimatum and the actual declaration of war by Germany against Russia on Saturday August st various sincere efforts were made to stave off the world shaking catastrophe Arranged chronologically these events may thus be summarized: Russia on July th formally asked Austria if she intended to annex Serbian territory by way of reprisal for the assassination at Sarajevo On the same day Austria replied that it had no present intention to make such annexation Russia then requested an extension of the forty eight hour time limit named in the ultimatum THE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES Austria on the morning of Saturday July th refused Russia's request for an extension of the period named in the ultimatum On the same day the newspapers published in Petrograd printed an official note issued by the Russian Government warning Europe generally that Russia would not remain indifferent to the fate of Serbia These newspapers also printed the appeal of the Serbian Crown Prince to the Czar dated on the preceding day urging that Russia come to the rescue of the menaced Serbs Serbia's peaceful reply surrendering on all points except one and agreeing to submit that to arbitration was sent late in the afternoon of the same day and that night Austria declared the reply to be unsatisfactory and withdrew its minister from Belgrade England commenced its attempts at pacification on the following day Sunday July th Sir Edward Grey spent the entire Sabbath in the Foreign Office and personally conducted the correspondence that was calculated to bring the dispute to a peaceful conclusion He did not reckon however with a Germany determined upon war a Germany whose manufacturers ship owners and Junkers had combined with its militarists to achieve Germany's place in the sun even though the world would be stained in the blood of the most frightful war this earth has ever known Realization of this fact did not come to Sir Edward Grey until his negotiations with Germany and with Austria Hungary had proceeded for some time His first suggestion was that the dispute between Russia and Austria be committed to the arbitration of Great Britain France Italy and Germany Russia accepted this but Germany and Austria rejected it Russia had previously suggested that the dispute be settled by a conference between the diplomatic heads at Vienna and Petrograd This also was refused by Austria Sir Edward Grey renewed his efforts on Monday July th with an invitation to Germany to present suggestions of its own looking toward a settlement This note was never answered Germany took the position that its proposition to compel Russia to stand aside while Austria punished Serbia had been rejected by England and France and it had nothing further to propose During all this period of negotiation the German Foreign Office to all outward appearances at least had been acting independently of the Kaiser who was in Norway on a vacation trip He returned to Potsdam on the night of Sunday July th On Monday morning the Czar of Russia received a personal message from the Kaiser urging Russia to stand aside that Serbia might be punished The Czar immediately replied with the suggestion that the whole matter be submitted to The Hague No reply of any kind was ever made to this proposal by Germany HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR THE GERMAN CONFEDERATION IN All suggestions and negotiations looking forward to peace were brought to a tragic end on the following day Tuesday July th when Austria declared war on Serbia having speedily mobilized troops at strategic points on the Serbian border Russian mobilization which had been proceeding only in a tentative way on the Austrian border now became general and on July th mobilization of the entire Russian army was proclaimed THE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES Germany's effort to exclude England from the war began on Thursday July th A note sounding Sir Edward Grey on the question of British neutrality in the event of war was received and a curt refusal to commit the British Empire to such a proposal was the reply Sir Edward Grey in a last determined effort to avoid a world war suggested to Germany Austria Serbia and Russia that the military operations commenced by Austria should be recognized as merely a punitive expedition He further suggested that when a point in Serbian territory previously fixed upon should have been reached Austria would halt and would submit her further action to arbitration in the conference of the Powers Russia and Serbia agreed unreservedly to this proposition Austria gave a half hearted assent to the principle involved Germany made no reply The die was cast for war on the following day July st when Germany made a dictatorial and arrogant demand upon Russia that mobilization of that nation's military forces be stopped within twelve hours Russia made no reply and on Saturday August st Germany set the world aflame with the dread of war's horror by her declaration of war upon Russia Germany's responsibility for this monumental crime against the peace of the world is eternally fixed upon her not only by these outward and visible acts and negotiations not only by her years of patient preparation for the war into which she plunged the world The responsibility is fastened upon her forever by the revelations of her own ambassador to England during this fateful period Prince Lichnowsky in a remarkable communication which was given to the world laid bare the machinations of the German High Command and its advisers He was a guest of the Kaiser at Kiel on board the Imperial yacht Meteor when the message was received informing the Kaiser of the assassination at Sarajevo His story continues: Being unacquainted with the Vienna viewpoint and what was going on there I attached no very far reaching significance to the event; but looking back I could feel sure that in the Austrian aristocracy a feeling of relief outweighed all others His Majesty regretted that his efforts to win over the Archduke to his ideas had thus been frustrated by the Archduke's assassination I went on to Berlin and saw the Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg I told him that I regarded our foreign situation as very satisfactory as it was a long time indeed since we had stood so well with England And in France there was a pacifist cabinet Herr von Bethmann Hollweg did not seem to share my optimism HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR He complained of the Russian armaments I tried to tranquilize him with the argument that it was not to Russia's interest to attack us and that such an attack would never have English or French support as both countries wanted peace I went from him to Dr Zimmermann (the under Secretary) who was acting for Herr von Jagow (the Foreign Secretary) and learned from him that Russia was about to call up nine hundred thousand new troops His words unmistakably denoted ill humor against Russia who he said stood everywhere in our way In addition there were questions of commercial policy that had to be settled That General von Moltke was urging war was of course not told to me I learned however that Herr von Tschirschky (the German Ambassador in Vienna) had been reproved because he said that he had advised Vienna to show moderation toward Serbia Prince Lichnowsky went to his summer home in Silesia quite unaware of the impending crisis He continues: When I returned from Silesia on my way to London I stopped only a few hours in Berlin where I heard that Austria intended to proceed against Serbia so as to bring to an end an unbearable state of affairs Unfortunately I failed at the moment to gauge the significance of the news I thought that once more it would come to nothing; that even if Russia acted threateningly the matter could soon be settled I now regret that I did not stay in Berlin and declare there and then that I would have no hand in such a policy There was a meeting in Potsdam as early as July th between the German and Austrian authorities at which meeting war was decided on Prince Lichnowsky says: I learned afterwards that at the decisive discussion at Potsdam on July th the Austrian demand had met with the unconditional approval of all the personages in authority; it was even added that no harm would be done if war with Russia did come out of it It was so stated at least in the Austrian report received at London by Count Mensdorff (the Austrian Ambassador to England) At this point I received instructions to endeavor to bring the English press to a friendly attitude in case Austria should deal the death blow to Greater Serbian hopes I was to use all my influence to prevent public opinion in England from taking a stand against Austria I remembered England's attitude during the Bosnian annexation crisis when public opinion showed itself in sympathy with the Serbian claims to Bosnia; I recalled also the benevolent promotion of nationalist hopes that went on in the days of Lord Byron and Garibaldi; and on these and other grounds I thought it extremely unlikely that English public opinion would support a punitive expedition against the Archduke's murderers THE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES Photos from International Film Service THE GERMAN CHANCELLORS On the right is Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg who is

into thinking that a democratic government had been set up in Germany HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR Press Illustrating Service THE DEPOSED RULERS OF AUSTRIA HUNGARY The ex Emperor Charles and his wife the ex Empress Zita in deep conversation with Hungarian leaders who are explaining the distressing situation confronting the country THE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES I thus felt it my duty to enter an urgent warning against the whole project which I characterized as venturesome and dangerous I recommended that counsels of moderation he given Austria as I did not believe that the conflict could be localized (that is to say it could not be limited to a war between Austria and Serbia) Herr von Jagow answered me that Russia was not prepared; that there would be more or less of a rumpus; but that the more firmly we stood by Austria the more surely would Russia give way Austria was already blaming us for flabbiness and we could not flinch On the other hand Russian sentiment was growing more unfriendly all the time and we must simply take the risk I subsequently learned that this attitude was based on advices from Count Pourtales (the German Ambassador in Petrograd) that Russia would not stir under any circumstances; information which prompted us to spur Count Berchtold on in his course On learning the attitude of the German Government I looked for salvation through English mediation knowing that Sir Edward Grey's influence in Petrograd could be used in the cause of peace I therefore availed myself of my friendly relations with the Minister to ask him confidentially to advise moderation in Russia in case Austria demanded satisfaction from the Serbians as it seemed likely she would The English press was quiet at first and friendly to Austria the assassination being generally condemned By degrees however more and more voices made themselves heard in the sense that however necessary it might be to take cognizance of the crime any exploitation of it for political ends was unjustifiable Moderation was enjoined upon Austria When the ultimatum came out all the papers with the exception of the Standard were unanimous in condemning it The whole world outside of Berlin and Vienna realized that it meant war and a world war too The English fleet which happened to have been holding a naval review was not demobilized The British Government labored to make the Serbian reply conciliatory and the Serbian answer was in keeping with the British efforts Sir Edward Grey then proposed his plan of mediation upon the two points which Serbia had not wholly conceded Prince Lichnowsky writes: M Cambon (for France) Marquis Imperiali (for Italy) and I were to meet with Sir Edward in the chair and it would have been easy to work out a formula for the debated points which had to do with the co operation of imperial and royal officials in the inquiries to be conducted at Belgrade By the exercise of good will everything could have been settled in one or two sittings and the mere acceptance of the British proposal would have relieved the strain and further improved our relations with England I seconded this plan with all my energies In vain I was told (by Berlin) that it would be against the dignity of Austria Of course all that was needed was one hint from Berlin to Count Berchtold (the Austrian Foreign Minister); he would have satisfied himself with a diplomatic triumph and rested on the Serbian answer That hint was never given On the contrary pressure was brought in favor of war… HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR After our refusal Sir Edward asked us to come forward with our proposal We insisted on war No other answer could I get (from Berlin) than that it was a colossal condescension on the part of Austria not to contemplate any acquisition of territory Sir Edward justly pointed out that one could reduce a country to vassalage without acquiring territory; that Russia would see this and regard it as a humiliation not to be put up with The impression grew stronger and stronger that we were bent on war Otherwise our attitude toward a question in which we were not directly concerned was incomprehensible The insistent requests and well defined declarations of M Sasanof the Czar's positively humble telegrams Sir Edward's repeated proposals the warnings of Marquis San Guiliano and of Bollati my own pressing admonitions were all of no avail Berlin remained inflexible Serbia must be slaughtered Then on the th Sir Edward decided upon his well known warning I told him I had always reported (to Berlin) that we should have to reckon with English opposition if it came to a war with France Time and again the Minister said to me If war breaks out it will be the greatest catastrophe the world has ever seen And now events moved rapidly Count Berchtold at last decided to come around having up to that point played the role of Strong man under guidance of Berlin Thereupon we (in answer to Russia's mobilization) sent our ultimatum and declaration of war after Russia had spent a whole week in fruitless negotiation and waiting Thus ended my mission in London It had suffered shipwreck not on the wiles of the Briton but on the wiles of our own policy Were not those right who saw that the German people was pervaded with the spirit of Treitschke and Bernhardi which glorifies war as an end instead of holding it in abhorrence as an evil thing Properly speaking militarism is a school for the people and an instrument to further political ends But in the patriarchal absolutism of a military monarchy militarism exploits politics to further its own ends and can create a situation which a democracy freed from junkerdom would not tolerate That is what our enemies think; that is what they are bound to think when they see that in spite of capitalistic industrialism and in spite of socialistic organizations the living as Nietzsche said are still ruled by the dead The democratization of Germany the first war aim proposed by our enemies will become a reality This is the frank statement of a great German statesman made long before Germany received its knock out blow It was written when Germany was sweeping all before it on land and when the U boat was at the height of its murderous powers on the high seas THE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES No one in nor out of Germany has controverted any of its statements and it will forever remain as one of the counts in the indictment against Germany and the sole cause of the world's greatest misery the war America's outstanding authority on matters of international conduct former Secretary of State Elihu Root declared that the World War was a mighty and allembracing struggle between two conflicting principles of human right and human duty; it was a conflict between the divine right of kings to govern mankind through armies and nobles and the right of the peoples of the earth who toil and endure and aspire to govern themselves by law under justice and in the freedom of individual manhood After the declaration of war against Russia by Germany events marched rapidly and inevitably toward the general conflagration Germany's most strenuous efforts were directed toward keeping England out of the conflict We have seen in the revelations of Prince Lichnowsky how eager was England to divert Germany's murderous purpose There are some details however required to fill in the diplomatic picture President Poincare of the French Republic on July th asked the British Ambassador in Paris for an assurance of British support On the following day he addressed a similar letter to King George of England Both requests were qualifiedly refused on the ground that England wished to be free to continue negotiations with Germany for the purpose of averting the war In the meantime the German Government addressed a note to England offering guarantees for Belgian integrity providing Belgium did not side with France offering to respect the neutrality of Holland and giving assurance that no French territory in Europe would be annexed if Germany won the war Sir Edward Grey described this as a shameful proposal and rejected it on July th On July st England sent a note to France and Germany asking for a statement of purpose concerning Belgian neutrality France immediately announced that it would respect the treaty of and its reaffirmation in guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality This treaty was entered into by Germany England France Austria and Russia Germany's reply on August st was a proposal that she would respect the neutrality of Belgium if England would stay out of the war This was promptly declined HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR On August d the British cabinet agreed that if the German fleet attempted to attack the coast of France the British fleet would intervene Germany the next day sent a note agreeing to refrain from naval attacks on France provided England would remain neutral but declined to commit herself as to the neutrality of Belgium Before this however on August d Germany had announced to Belgium its intention to enter Belgium for the purpose of attacking France The Belgian Minister in London made an appeal to the British Foreign Office and was informed that invasion of Belgium by Germany would be followed by England's declaration of war Monday August d was signalized by Belgium's declaration of its neutrality and its firm purpose to defend its soil against invasion by France England Germany or any other nation The actual invasion of Belgium commenced on the morning of August th when twelve regiments of Uhlans crossed the frontier near Vise and came in contact with a Belgian force driving it back upon Liege King Albert of Belgium promptly appealed to England Russia and France for aid in repelling the invader England sent an ultimatum to Germany fixing midnight of August th as the time for expiration of the ultimatum This demanded that satisfactory assurances be furnished immediately that Germany would respect the neutrality of Belgium No reply was made by Germany and England's declaration of war followed Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg of the German Empire wrote Germany's infamy into history when in a formal statement he acknowledged that the invasion of Belgium was a wrong that we will try to make good again as soon as our military ends have been reached To Sir Edward Vochen British Ambassador to Germany he addressed the inquiry: Is it the purpose of your country to make war upon Germany for the sake of a scrap of paper The treaty of guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality was the scrap of paper With the entrance of England into the war the issue between autocracy and democracy was made plain before the people of the world Austria and later Turkey joined with Germany; France and Japan by reason of their respective treaty obligations joined England and Russia Italy for the time preferred to remain neutral ignoring her implied alliance with the Teutonic empires How other nations lined up on the one side and the other is indicated by the State Department's list of war declarations and diplomatic severances which follows: Austria against

declared war against civilization it was decided by the German General Staff to strike at France through Belgium The records of the German Foreign Office prove that fact The reason for this lay in the long line of powerful fortresses along the line that divides France from Germany and the sparsely spaced and comparatively out of date forts on the border between Germany and Belgium True there was a treaty guaranteeing the inviolability of Belgian territory to which Germany was a signatory party Some of the clauses of that treaty were: Article Belgium within the limits traced in conformity with the principles laid down in the present preliminaries shall form a perpetually neutral state The five powers (England France Austria Prussia and Russia) without wishing to intervene in the internal affairs of Belgium guarantee her that perpetual neutrality as well as the integrity and inviolability of her territory in the limits mentioned in the present article Article By just reciprocity Belgium shall be held to observe this same neutrality toward all the other states and to make no attack on their internal or external tranquillity while always preserving the right to defend herself against any foreign aggression This agreement was followed on January by a definitive treaty accepted by Belgium and by the Netherlands which treaty regulates Belgium's neutrality as follows: Article Belgium within the limits defined in Articles and shall form an independent and perpetually neutral state She is obligated to preserve this neutrality against all the other states To convert this solemn covenant into a scrap of paper it was necessary that Germany should find an excuse for tearing it to pieces There was absolutely no provocation in sight but that did not deter the German High Command That august body with no information whatever to afford an excuse alleged in a formal note to the Belgian Government that the French army intended to invade Germany through Belgian territory This hypocritical and mendacious note and Belgium's vigorous reply follow: HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR Note handed in on August at o'clock P M by Herr von Below Saleske German Minister to M Davignon Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs BRUSSELS d August IMPERIAL GERMAN LEGATION IN BELGIUM (Highly confidential) The German Government has received reliable information according to which the French forces intend to march on the Meuse by way of Givet and Namur This information leaves no doubt as to the intention of France of marching on Germany through Belgian territory The Imperial Government cannot avoid the fear that Belgium in spite of its best will will be in no position to repulse such a largely developed French march without aid In this fact there is sufficient certainty of a threat directed against Germany It is an imperative duty for the preservation of Germany to forestall this attack of the enemy The German Government would feel keen regret if Belgium should regard as an act of hostility against herself the fact that the measures of the enemies of Germany oblige her on her part to violate Belgian territory In order to dissipate any misunderstanding the German Government declares as follows: Germany does not contemplate any act of hostility against Belgium If Belgium consents in the war about to commence to take up an attitude of friendly neutrality toward Germany the German Government on its part undertakes on the declaration of peace to guarantee the kingdom and its possessions in their whole extent Germany undertakes under the conditions laid down to evacuate Belgian territory as soon as peace is concluded If Belgium preserves a friendly attitude Germany is prepared in agreement with the authorities of the Belgian Government to buy against cash all that is required by her troops and to give indemnity for the damages caused in Belgium If Belgium behaves in a hostile manner toward the German troops and in particular raises difficulties against their advance by the opposition of the fortifications of the Meuse or by destroying roads railways tunnels or other engineering works Germany will be compelled to consider Belgium as an enemy In this case Germany will take no engagements toward Belgium but she will leave the later settlement of relations of the two states toward one another to the decision of arms The German Government has a justified hope that this contingency will not arise and that the Belgian Government will know how to take suitable measures to hinder its taking place In this case the friendly relations which unite the two neighboring states will become closer and more lasting THE GREAT WAR BEGINS THE REPLY BY BELGIUM Note handed in by M Davignon Minister for Foreign Affairs to Herr von BelowSaleske German Minister
